            "  <br><br>You have been asked to participate because you accepted the HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk." +

            "  <br>If you decide to participate in this research you will be presented with visual displays containing images and/or text and will be asked to make judgments about them. For example, you may see shapes and be asked how round they appear or view a graph with a legend and interpret information about the data in the graph. You will be asked to respond by making button presses on a keyboard/mouse. You may be asked to complete questionnaires about your expertise or educational level in a given domain (e.g., neuroscience) and questionnaires about what sorts of things you like/dislike. Finally, you may be asked to respond to questions about your experience during the experiment (e.g., how much you enjoyed the task)." +

The compensation amount for this HIT, as specified in the HIT description, was pre-determined based on the amount of time it took previous participants to do similar tasks." +
